# Enhanced Logistics Planner Implementation

## üéØ Overview

The Enhanced Logistics Planner is a comprehensive segment-focused route optimization system that combines AI-powered coordinate extraction with maritime route calculation to create optimal logistics routes. It intelligently determines the best combination of sea and land transport segments based on the origin and destination characteristics.

## üöÄ Key Features

### 1. **AI-Powered Coordinate Extraction**
- Uses Nominatim (OpenStreetMap) geocoding service to extract coordinates from place names
- Extensible to integrate with advanced AI/LLM services
- Handles various location formats and place names

### 2. **Intelligent Route Segmentation**
The system automatically determines the optimal route type based on location characteristics:

- **Port to Port**: Direct sea route using maritime shipping
- **Inland to Inland**: Land-Sea-Land route via nearest major ports
- **Port to Inland**: Sea-Land route from port to final destination
- **Inland to Port**: Land-Sea route to destination port

### 3. **Maritime Route Integration**
- Integrates with existing `get_maritime_route()` function for precise sea route calculation
- Uses SeaRoute Java application with maritime network data
- Provides detailed waypoints for accurate route visualization
- Fallback to straight-line calculation when SeaRoute is unavailable

### 4. **Major Ports Database**
Includes comprehensive database of major world ports:
- Shanghai, Rotterdam, Singapore, Los Angeles, Hamburg
- Buenaventura, Callao, Antwerp, Hong Kong, Dubai
- New York, Yokohama, and more
- Automatic port detection and selection
