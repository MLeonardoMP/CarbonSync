# **App Name**: CarbonSync

## Core Features:

- Real-Time Geo-Visor: Display vehicles moving in real-time (trucks, ships, trains) on a map, showing ID, type, mode, route, speed, timestamp, CO2e emitted, ETA, fuel type, carrier name, origin, destination, last updated.
- Detailed Vehicle Information: On vehicle click, display a side panel with current CO2 emissions, distance traveled, ETA, fuel type, load factor, cost per km, and carrier name.
- Vehicle Filtering: Allow filtering of vehicles by mode (truck, rail, sea), region, carrier, and emission threshold.
- Emissions Dashboard: Generate visual dashboards to display total emissions by date, mode, and carrier, emissions per shipment or route, and carbon intensity per ton-km, selectable by time range (week, month, quarter).
- AI-Powered Search: Integrate an AI assistant that uses a tool to assist users to formulate natural language queries to filter the presented data (e.g., 'show all shipments over 5 tons CO2')
- Role-Based Permissions: Implement role-based access control, where admins can access all app data, carriers see data only for their own vehicles and analysts can create reports.
- Route Optimization (AI Assisted): AI can suggest routes optimized for emissions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2962FF) to convey trust and corporate responsibility, drawing inspiration from AB InBev's established branding while signifying reliability and technological innovation.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F9), desaturated from the primary blue, providing a neutral backdrop that ensures legibility and reduces eye strain during prolonged use.
- Accent color: Vibrant teal (#00BCD4) to highlight key data points, interactive elements, and calls to action, creating visual contrast against the blue palette and symbolizing environmental consciousness.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif for a modern and neutral feel that works well in dashboards and reports.
- Use flat, minimalist icons that represent different modes of transport (truck, rail, ship) and emission-related metrics.
- Employ a modular layout with clear divisions for the Geo-Visor, dashboards, and controls.
- Incorporate subtle animations for data updates and vehicle movements on the map, enhancing the real-time experience without being distracting.
